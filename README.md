# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a webpage where users search for any city around the world and view the current weather conditions, a 5-day forecast and their history of what cities they searched. Once on the page, users can type in a city of their choice in the text box just below "Search for a City". Under "Today's Weather:" users will be able to view the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity and an icon representation of weather conditions. Users can click back on previous cities they searched to see the information again. 

## Usage

Users can follow the link to the deployed webpage to access the weather dashboard. Enter a city around the world of your choice and click "submit" below to access the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast for that city. Search for a different city to view its weather conditions and see your previous searches stored under "Search History:". Click back on cities in your search history to once again view its weather conditions.
